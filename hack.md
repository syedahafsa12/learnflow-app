Part 1: Introduction
Welcome to the Reusable Intelligence and Cloud-Native Mastery Hackathon! This hackathon represents a paradigm shift in software development. Instead of writing code manually, you'll learn to teach AI coding agents how to build sophisticated cloud-native agentic applications autonomously.
What You'll Learn
By the end of this hackathon, you will:
Understand and implement the MCP Code Execution Implementation with Skills
Create reusable skills that work with both Claude Code and Goose
Deploy containerized applications on Kubernetes
Build event-driven microservices using Kafka and Dapr
Understand Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) Standards
Create a complete AI-powered learning platform (LearnFlow)
The Big Picture
Think of this hackathon as learning to be a teacher for AI. Rather than writing every line of code yourself, you'll create "Measurable Skills" that teach Claude Code and Goose how to architect, containerize, and orchestrate distributed systems. These skills become reusable knowledge that AI agents can apply to build complex applications autonomously.
💡 Key Concept: From Coder to Teacher
Traditional Development: You write code → Code runs → Application works
Agentic Development: You write Skills → AI learns patterns → AI writes code → Application works
The difference: Your skills can be reused to build many applications, not just one.


Critical: The Skills are the Product
The Skills are the product, not just documentation or the LearnFlow apps you create.
Judges will evaluate both the development process behind your Skills AND test the Skills with Claude Code and Goose. Your goal: make your skills work autonomously to get in the winners queue.
🛠️ Your Action Plan
Step 1: The "Unification" (Understand Standards)
The Challenge: Take a standard task (e.g., "Design a Next.js Frontend").
The Action: Look at how you did it in a Claude Skill with MCP
The Deliverable: Recreate the Skill where MCP is Code executable instead of agent integration
Step 2: The "Build" (Construct LearnFlow)
The Challenge: Build the LearnFlow platform (Microservices, Kafka, Dapr).
The Action: DO NOT write Skills directly or integrate MCP servers with Coding Agentss. DO NOT write application code manually.
The Deliverable: Write Skills with MCP executed in Code for every component (e.g., `kafka-setup.md`, `tutor-api.md`). Let Claude Code and Goose build the actual app.

Hackathon 2: You wrote Skills for Claude.
Hackathon 3: You write Skills with MCP Code Execution
Part 2A: Glossary of Terms
Before diving in, familiarize yourself with these key terms. Refer back to this section whenever you encounter unfamiliar terminology.
Term
Definition
Claude Code
Anthropic's agentic CLI tool. It can write, execute, and debug code autonomously. Uses "Skills" (SKILL.md files) to learn new capabilities.
Goose
Open-source local AI agent from the Agentic AI Foundation. Uses "Recipes" (recipe.yaml files) to learn new capabilities.
Skill
The emerging industry-standard format for teaching AI agents capabilities. A SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter containing instructions and supporting scripts. Works on Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Goose.
Recipe
Goose's format for learning capabilities. A recipe.yaml file with title, description, instructions, activities, and extensions.
MCP
Model Context Protocol. A standard for giving AI agents real-time access to external data sources like databases, APIs, or your Kubernetes cluster.
Dapr
Distributed Application Runtime. A sidecar that handles state management, pub/sub messaging, and service invocation for microservices.
Kafka
A distributed event streaming platform. Services publish events to "topics" and other services subscribe to receive them asynchronously.
Kubernetes (K8s)
Container orchestration platform. Manages deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications across clusters of machines.
Minikube
A tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally on your machine for development and testing.
Helm
Package manager for Kubernetes. Helm "charts" are pre-configured templates for deploying applications like Kafka or PostgreSQL.
Spec-Kit Plus
A framework for spec-driven development. You define application behavior in specification files, then AI agents generate the implementation.
AGENTS.md
A markdown file that describes a repository's structure, conventions, and guidelines so AI agents can understand how to work with the codebase.


Part 2B: Goose vs Claude Code
Goose and Claude Code are both powerful AI agents for software development, but they have fundamental differences in architecture, flexibility, and focus.
In short: Goose is an open-source AAIF Standard, local-first, LLM-agnostic agent framework for full workflow automation. Claude Code is a proprietary, cloud-first, Claude-model-specific tool that focuses on code-centric tasks.

Here is a detailed comparison:
Feature
Goose (AAIF Standard)
Claude Code (by Anthropic)
Architecture
Local-first, extensible, open-source AAIF Standard AI agent. Runs on your machine (CLI/Desktop app).
Cloud-first agentic development tool. Leverages Anthropic's cloud services.
LLM Flexibility
LLM-Agnostic. Works with any LLM that supports tool calling, including local models (like open-source models) and commercial ones (like Claude, GPT, Gemini).
Claude-Specific. Tied exclusively to Anthropic's Claude models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 4 Opus). But can use other models by using Claude Code Router.
Core Function
Full Autonomous Workflow Orchestration. Automates complex, end-to-end engineering tasks (scaffolding, installing deps, running tests, interacting with APIs, etc.).
Code-centric Operations. Excels at searching, explaining, editing code, performing PR reviews, and managing issues.
Code Execution
Direct System Execution (on the local machine) or via MCP servers. Can directly write, execute, debug, and test code.
Direct Action via integration with the development environment (reading/editing files, running commands).
Control & Security
Maximum Local Control/Security. Code and data primarily remain on your machine. Excellent for sensitive or air-gapped environments.
Cloud-based Security/Control. Relies on Anthropic's security measures and cloud infrastructure.
Pricing
Model Dependent. You only pay for the LLM you choose to use (API costs). The Goose framework itself is open-source.
Subscription/API Model. You pay Anthropic for the service and the underlying Claude model usage.
Best For
Developers who need full local control, multi-model flexibility, and end-to-end automation across their entire engineering pipeline.
Developers who want top-tier code intelligence and are already invested in the Claude ecosystem for code-specific tasks and refactoring.


🔑 Key Takeaways
Flexibility and Control: Goose wins on flexibility as you can plug in the best-performing or most cost-effective LLM for a given task (even Claude!). It also provides more security and local control since it runs on your machine
Breadth of Automation: Goose is designed to be a general-purpose engineering assistant that can orchestrate entire workflows, not just coding tasks Claude Code is a more specialized tool focused primarily on code and repository management
Code Quality: Claude models (Opus, Sonnet) are often cited on benchmarks as being among the best for raw code generation accuracy and quality, particularly for complex reasoning and adhering to multi-step instructions Goose's performance in this area will depend entirely on the specific LLM you configure it to use.
In summary, if you value open-source, local execution, and the ability to swap models, Goose is the stronger choice. If you prioritize having Anthropic's SOTA code LLMs directly integrated into your terminal environment for code-specific tasks, Claude Code is a powerful contender.
Part 3: Understanding Skills with MCP Code Execution
The Industry Convergence 
Skills are the emerging standard for teaching AI coding agents. The industry has converged on Claude's Skills format:



💡 Skills written once work across Claude Code, Codex, and Goose. No transpilation needed.

The Token Problem: MCP Bloat

When you connect MCP servers directly to an agent, every tool definition loads into context at startup:

MCP Servers Connected
Token Cost BEFORE Conversation
1 server (5 tools)
~10,000 tokens
3 servers (15 tools)
~30,000 tokens
5 servers (25 tools)
~50,000+ tokens


⚠️ With 5 MCP servers, you've consumed 25% of your context window before typing a single prompt.

But it gets worse. Every intermediate result also flows through context:

Direct MCP call - transcript flows through context TWICE

TOOL CALL: gdrive.getDocument(documentId: "abc123")

        → returns full transcript (25,000 tokens into context)


TOOL CALL: salesforce.updateRecord(data: { Notes: [full transcript] })

        → model writes transcript again (25,000 more tokens)

  
Total: 50,000 tokens for a simple copy operation

The Solution: Skills + Code Execution

Instead of loading MCP tools directly, wrap them in Skills that execute scripts:

The Pattern:
SKILL.md tells the agent WHAT to do (~100 tokens)
scripts/*.py does the actual work (0 tokens - executed, not loaded)
Only the final result enters context (minimal tokens)




Context Window Optimization: From Direct MCP to Skills + Scripts

The diagram illustrates a significant improvement in the agent's context window efficiency, moving from a "Before" state using Direct MCP (Managed Context Pool) to an "After" state leveraging Skills and Scripts.

Before (Direct MCP): High Context Consumption
Agent Context Window Contents:
MCP Tool Definitions (50k tokens)
Intermediate Results (50k tokens)
Your Conversation (variable tokens)
Consumption Rate: 41% of the context window is consumed before the agent even starts processing the task.
After (Skills + Scripts): Minimal Context Consumption
Mechanism:
A compact SKILL.md file ($\sim$100 tokens) references an external script (scripts/tool.py).
The external script executes outside of the main context window.
The only output returned to the context window is the minimal result, e.g., "✓ Done."
Consumption Rate: Only 3% of the context window is consumed, leaving 97% free for work.
This can result in 80-98% token reduction while maintaining full capability

How It Works: Code Execution with MCP?
From Anthropic's engineering blog (Nov 2025):

Strategy: Treat MCP Servers as Code APIs for Efficient Agent Interaction

The core idea is to shift from direct, high-volume tool calls to having the agent write code that interacts with the MCP servers via APIs. This allows for client-side processing, dramatically reducing the data volume the agent's context needs to handle.

The Problem with Direct MCP Tool Calls (Inefficient):
Action: A direct tool call is made.
Result: The entire dataset flows into the agent's context.
Example (Inefficient): All 10,000 rows flow through context
TOOL CALL: gdrive.getSheet(sheetId: 'abc123')
        → returns 10,000 rows in context

The Solution: Code Execution for Data Filtering (Efficient):
Action: The agent executes a script using the server's functionality as an API.
Result: Data filtering and processing occur within the script, and only the necessary, filtered output is returned to the agent's context.
Example (Efficient): Filter happens in script, only 5 rows reach context

const allRows = await gdrive.getSheet({ sheetId: 'abc123' });
const pending = allRows.filter(row => row.Status === 'pending');
console.log(pending.slice(0, 5)); // Only log first 5
Outcome: The agent's context sees only 5 relevant rows instead of 10,000, leading to significant efficiency gains.
Building Skills with MCP Code Execution

Here's the pattern you'll implement in this hackathon:

Directory Structure:

.claude/skills/kafka-k8s-setup/
├── SKILL.md              # Instructions (~100 tokens)
├── REFERENCE.md          # Deep docs (loaded on-demand)
└── scripts/
    ├── deploy.sh         # Executes Helm commands
    ├── verify.py         # Calls kubectl, returns status
    └── mcp_client.py     # Wraps MCP calls (optional)


SKILL.md (What the agent loads):
---
name: kafka-k8s-setup
description: Deploy Apache Kafka on Kubernetes
---

# Kafka Kubernetes Setup

## When to Use
- User asks to deploy Kafka
- Setting up event-driven microservices

## Instructions
1. Run deployment: `./scripts/deploy.sh`
2. Verify status: `python scripts/verify.py`
3. Confirm all pods Running before proceeding.

## Validation
- [ ] All pods in Running state
- [ ] Can create test topic

See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for configuration options.


scripts/deploy.sh (What actually executes):

#!/bin/bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace kafka --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
helm install kafka bitnami/kafka --namespace kafka \
  --set replicaCount=1 \
  --set zookeeper.replicaCount=1

# Only this output enters agent context:
echo "✓ Kafka deployed to namespace 'kafka'"


scripts/verify.py (Returns minimal result):
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess, json, sys

result = subprocess.run(
    ["kubectl", "get", "pods", "-n", "kafka", "-o", "json"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
pods = json.loads(result.stdout)["items"]

running = sum(1 for p in pods if p["status"]["phase"] == "Running")
total = len(pods)

# Only this enters context - not the full pod JSON
if running == total:
    print(f"✓ All {total} pods running")
    sys.exit(0)
else:
    print(f"✗ {running}/{total} pods running")
    sys.exit(1)


Component
Tokens
Notes
SKILL.md
 ~100
 Loaded when triggered
REFERENCE.md
 0

verify.py
 0

Final output
 ~10
 "✓ All 3 pods running"


Total: ~110 tokens vs 50,000+ with direct MCP

Advanced Pattern: MCP Server as Skill

For MCP servers you use frequently, convert them to Skills:

Before (MCP Server loaded at startup): ~/.claude/mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "kubernetes": { "command": "mcp-k8s-server" }
  }
}

# Cost: ~15,000 tokens at startup, every session

After (Skill + Script): .claude/skills/k8s-ops/SKILL.md

---
name: k8s-ops
description: Kubernetes operations via kubectl
---

## Instructions
Use scripts in this directory for K8s operations:
- `scripts/get_pods.py <namespace>` - List pods
- `scripts/get_logs.py <pod> <namespace>` - Get logs
- `scripts/apply.py <file>` - Apply manifest

# Cost: ~100 tokens when triggered, 0 otherwise

Your Hackathon Challenge

Hackathon 2: You wrote Skills for Claude.
Hackathon 3: You write Skills with MCP Code Execution.

For each skill you create:
SKILL.md — Minimal instructions (~100 tokens)
scripts/ — Code that does the heavy lifting (0 tokens)
REFERENCE.md — Deep docs loaded only when needed

The goal: Single prompt → Agent loads skill → Script executes → Minimal result → Task complete.

Remember: The Skill is the Product and how it was developed is the process.

Judges will evaluate both the development process behind your Skills AND test them with Claude Code and Goose. Your goal: make your skills work autonomously to get in the winners queue.
Part 10: FAQ & Troubleshooting
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Do I need to build both Claude Code and Goose versions?
A: Yes, both are required. This demonstrates that your Skills are truly portable. Since Goose reads .claude/skills/ directly, the same skills work on both agents.
Q: What if Claude Code or Goose generates incorrect code?
A: This is expected! The goal is to refine your Skills until the AI generates correct code consistently. Document what changes you made to improve the skills.
Q: Can I use other AI models besides Claude and Goose?
A: Yes, you can use Claude Code Router to integrate Gemini or other APIs. However, Claude Code and Goose are required as the primary agents.
Q: How much should the AI do vs. manual coding?
A: Aim for maximum autonomy. Your evaluation score increases when AI agents can complete tasks with minimal manual intervention. The gold standard is single-prompt-to-deployment.
Common Issues & Solutions
⚠️ Issue: Minikube won't start
Symptoms: "Exiting due to DRV_NOT_HEALTHY" or Docker errors
Solution:
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. minikube delete && minikube start --driver=docker
3. If on Mac M1/M2: minikube start --driver=docker --alsologtostderr


⚠️ Issue: Helm chart installation fails
Symptoms: "no matches for kind" or version errors
Solution:
helm repo update
helm search repo bitnami/kafka --versions  # Find compatible version
helm install kafka bitnami/kafka --version X.Y.Z


⚠️ Issue: Claude Code not recognizing Skills
Symptoms: Skill doesn't appear or isn't used
Solution:
1. Verify SKILL.md is in .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
2. Check YAML frontmatter syntax (--- at start and end)
3. Run: claude --debug to see skill loading
4. Ensure allowed-tools are valid tool names


⚠️ Issue: Pods stuck in Pending state
Symptoms: kubectl get pods shows Pending for >5 minutes
Solution:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>  # Check Events section
# Common causes:
# - Insufficient resources: Increase Minikube memory
# - PVC issues: Check storage class exists
# - Image pull: Verify image name and registry access
